# Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

---

## Tools Used
- Online free password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).

---

## 1. Introduction
A password is the first line of defense in securing online accounts. Strong passwords are harder to guess or crack using brute force or dictionary attacks.
This task focuses on creating multiple passwords, testing them, and learning best practices for password creation.

## 2. Passwords Tested
| No. | Password            | Type of Password               |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1   | abcdef              | Only lowercase                 |
| 2   | Abcd1234            | Mixed letters & numbers        |
| 3   | MangoTree2025       | Passphrase (letters & numbers) |
| 4   | J\$7rP\@q1          | Mixed with special chars       |
| 5   | Mango\$Sky#Blue2025 | Long complex passphrase        |

## 3. Test Results
| Password            | Score (%) | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback from Tool                          |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| abcdef              |  0%       | Instant              | Too short, no variety                       |
| Abcd1234            | 64%       | 1 Hours              | Needs special characters                    |
| MangoTree2025       | 99%       | Decades              | Increase length and add special chars       |
| J\$7rP\@q1          | 92%       | 8 Hours              | Strong, increase length for better security |
| Mango\$Sky#Blue2025 | 100%      | Centuries            | Very strong, excellent length & variety     |

## 4. Best Practices Learned
- Use at least 12–16 characters

- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

- Avoid personal info & dictionary words

- Use passphrases for memorability

- Change passwords regularly

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## 5. Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations

- Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common passwords

- Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked username-password pairs from breaches

## 6. Conclusion
Stronger passwords significantly increase resistance to attacks. Complexity and length are the key factors in making a password secure. Using MFA and password managers further strengthens account protection.
